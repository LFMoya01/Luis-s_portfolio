## Project 1: Chile deforestation and relationship with net carbon emissions

- **Description**: The main purpose of this project is to visualize the relationship between the net carbon emissions and the deforestation in the country for a forest canopy threshold of 75 percent.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python 3.11.7 running on Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib & seaborn.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations.
  - Statistical analysis.
  - **Data information**: "This dataset, titled "Global Forest Data (2001-2022): Tree Cover, Biomass, and Carbon Flux Analysis," presents a comprehensive overview of global forestry metrics over 21 years. It includes data on tree cover                                 extent, aboveground live woody biomass (AGB) stocks and densities, along with detailed annual records of tree cover loss and forest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2001 to 2022. The data set is enhanced by                                insights into annual average forest CO2 removals (sequestration) and the net GHG flux at both the country and first sub-national levels."
