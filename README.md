# Data Analyst Portfolio

A brief collection of my data analysis projects showcasing various skills and techniques in the field of data analysis. It is only an insight to my habilites and also you can read more about my [mindset](https://github.com/LFMoya01/Luis-s_portfolio/blob/main/My%20mindset).

## Project 1: Chile deforestation and relationship with net carbon emissions

- **Description**: The main purpose of this project is to visualize the relationship between the net carbon emissions and the deforestation in the country for a forest canopy threshold of 75 percent.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python 3.11.7 running on Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib & seaborn.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations.
  - Statistical analysis.
  - **Data information**: "This dataset, titled "Global Forest Data (2001-2022): Tree Cover, Biomass, and Carbon Flux Analysis," presents a comprehensive overview of global forestry metrics over 21 years. It includes data on tree cover                                 extent, aboveground live woody biomass (AGB) stocks and densities, along with detailed annual records of tree cover loss and forest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2001 to 2022. The data set is enhanced by                                insights into annual average forest CO2 removals (sequestration) and the net GHG flux at both the country and first sub-national levels."

## Project 2: AUD/CLP price prediction

- **Description**: The main purpose of this project is to use a basic linear regression in order to predict the short term price evolution of AUD/CLP.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Python 3.11.7 running on Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib & seaborn.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizations.
  - Linear regression.
  - **Data information**: "Data shows the price evolution per day since January 2nd 2023"

## NDA protected projects

- Due to the signature of NDA with my clients/employer I am unable to reproduce the followings projects and only 5 projects from a total of 15 can be mentioned with a basic description. This is the backbone of my Data analyst career since 2019.

- **Protected project 1, client: Chilean goverment, Year:2019**: Utilize OSINT and give some insights about improvements in public safety. Tech and Tools: Propietary software
- **Protected project 2, client: Huawei Chile for WOM Chile, Year:2023**: Provide insigths about the energization of the "Austral optical fibre project" in remote areas in Southern Chile. Tech and Tools: Huawei Threecloud Ecosystem
- **Protected project 3, client: Huawei Chile, Year:2023**: Comparation of emergency energy methods for MBB (Mobile BroadBand) and FBB (Fixed BroadBand) in different scenarios, the main goal was get a cost/effieciency solution. Tech and Tools: Huawei Threecloud Ecosystem
- **Protected project 4, client: Private hiring, Year:2024**: Realize deep analysis about the installation of an off-grid "Crypto mining" farm in the Chilean Patagonia. Tech and Tools: Python 3, Geopandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and pvlib.
- **Protected project 5, client: CMPC Biopacking, Year:2024**: Check factibility for a hybrid biomass-solar energy project to power the paperboard production line . Tech and Tools: MATLAB Simulink, PLECS, Python 3, matplotlib, seaborn, Geopandas and pvlib.
