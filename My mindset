# My Journey in Data Analytics

## Introduction
I began learning about data analytics-related topics in 2018 after a conversation with a university professor about the lack of data specialists in electrical engineering positions. Initially, I learned the basics through Coursera courses offered by Google and IBM. These courses introduced me to "root problem analysis" and some fundamental libraries. As a young Bachelor student, I wanted to learn everything, but I soon realized that the most effective way to link data analytics with electrical engineering was by focusing on analyzing large volumes of data.

## Early Development
I continued developing my analytical skills and began learning about AI and OSINT. By 2019, my skills were still basic but sufficient to complete one of my first projects with the Chilean government, which ended successfully. Between 2020 and 2022, I focused on learning more about data visualization, AI, Machine Learning, and Quantum Technology.

## Professional Experience
In 2023, I completed an internship with Huawei Chile in the Data Analytics department, initially working with the Digital Energy team and later transitioning to the Digital Marketing Sales department. Beyond gaining knowledge in Data Analytics, Cloud Computing, Big Data, OSINT for corporate affairs, and Business Analytics, I also learned about the corporate world and the mindset of Chinese multinational companies. After finishing my internship, I worked as a freelancer until I completed my degree in 2024 and moved to Australia.

## My Analytical Mindset
I do not have a background in computer science, so I am not a programmer who can code an entire model from scratch. Instead, I specialize in using existing models, data analysis templates, and AI chatbots to clean, visualize, and predict trends using standard algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

The real value lies in giving meaning to data visualizations and comparing them with other information, such as technical specifications (e.g., maximum power output of a solar inverter) and external events (e.g., natural disasters, wars, economic crises, pandemics). Identifying correlations and causality is one of an analyst’s core abilities.

I have developed an "almost quantum" analytical thinking approach. Instead of looking for a single root cause, I analyze a network of inputs and outputs, evaluating the probability of various factors causing a problem and considering the vast range of possible outcomes. For instance, if a wind turbine in the Magellan Strait reports a failure to SCADA, the most probable cause could be bad weather. However, other possibilities include poor maintenance, internal or external sabotage, or sensor failure. 

An analyst must not only identify solutions but also determine the most cost-effective one. This approach extends beyond troubleshooting to various applications, such as:
- Assessing the feasibility of solar energy solutions for remote facilities.
- Analyzing how the energy market relates to climate change in a specific country.
- Evaluating a country’s primary energy sources and understanding how its evolving energy mix relates to climatic conditions.

## Future Prospects
There are numerous potential projects where I can apply my skills, from energy analytics to broader economic and environmental studies even getting mor involved in Quantum programming. I am eager to contribute to meaningful projects that leverage data analytics to drive informed decision-making and problem-solving.
